> I spend most of the time working on setting up Javascript logic while also utilizing bootstrapper for easier styling. I had some issue with storing user input when navigating the DOM. It was took alot of time to go through at first but after researching and reviewing on class Material, the logic became more clear and I was able to apply the concept and made it work.
